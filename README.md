# charsInsideIntegers
A C program that takes 4 characters and packs their values into a single integer. Since each char can be represented as 1 byte, and an unsigned integer is 4 bytes, all four chars can be stored as a single integer.

The program prompts the user for 4 characters. These characters are then printed
   as an integr representation, and a bit string of 1 byte. The binary value of the 4 individual characters
   is then packed into a single unsigned integer value. This integer is stored in 4 bytes and each 
   byte corresponds to the binary value of one of the 4 entered character.
   This integer is outputted to the application along with its binary value.
